faw words of my project:

* I make my project about selling rock albums and the products are albums from two bands that i very much like  .

* I took a template fro W3, it is the base design of the project.
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_clothing_store.htm

* I decided that my products will be display with JS function and arry so it can change by the selecting user
   and so i dose'nt have to make more then one HTML file, i used the same method on the last HW the contact list.

* I used Local Storage to keep the products that added to cart or wishlist after refreshing the browser.

* i used bootstrap button for some of the buttons and W3 icons.

* i have to say i very much enjoy making this project and i spent alot of time and effert to make it work, i hope you like it same as i do
